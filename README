This extension provides in-browser editing of uploaded SVG files using the very nice
open-source SVG-edit widget:

  http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

SVG-edit 2.7-trunk (revision 2533) is included at present.

Current versions of most major browsers should work except for Internet Explorer 8 and below.

Known bugs:
* Actual editor issues belong upstream: http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

Todo:
* add an editor trigger on SVG images visible in regular page views
